- [x] Develop your Website as fully isolated modules, in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## ðŸšŒ Roadmap

- [x] Skeleton to create website with by creating the DOM
- [x] A webpage can have Modules
  - [x] Each module is surrounded by a wrapper `div`
- [x] A page is created with isolated modules (HTML only)
- [x] Modules can have Modules, infinite loops are prevented
  - [x] Submodules have `RuntimeInformation` available
- [x] `<head>` modules only
- [x] The wrapping `div` tag can be disabled *(recommended only for `<head>` modules)*
- [x] File hierarchy for CSS and JS is defined
  - [ ] Prevent `/` in IDs
  - [ ] Remove `..` in IDs
- [ ] CSS integration
  - [x] Combining files is implemented
  - [x] Minimization of CSS is implemented
  - [x] Modules without CSS are skipped
  - [ ] CSS links are automatically inserted into the HTML `<head>` tag if files are available
  - [ ] CSS can be split up into "render critical" (will be inlined on rendering) and "non render critical" parts
  - [ ] A CSS register is implemented that can be used as shared global querying instance for CSS files
- [x] Modules are isolated (HTML, CSS)
- [ ] Page specific CSS is possible
- [ ] JavaScript integration
  - [ ] Combining files is implemented
  - [ ] Minimization is implemented
- [ ] HTML can be streamed
- [ ] Modules are now fully isolated (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- [ ] JavaScript and CSS can be compiled into the binary
- [ ] Add attributes to the container wrapping the module
- [ ] Configuration using `.toml` files
  - [ ] Modules
  - [ ] Pages
- [ ] Added [html5-picture](https://github.com/emirror-de/html5-picture) support
  - [ ] Conversion of pictures on startup is possible
  - [ ] API for a global register that holds all pictures and creates the HTML code
- [ ] Provide an API for localization (l10n)
- [ ] Provide an API for generic resources
- [ ] Modules can have isolated folders for temporary files
  - [ ] CSS attributes can be configured
- [ ] Modules can send events to sub-modules

Say goodbye to the web template hell. Generate your HTML5 website technically optimized and always valid. Without leaving Rust source.

*This is the adjusted Rust implementation of [the PHP version of lewp](https://gitlab.com/lewp/lewp).*

## ‚ùìWhat is lewp?

Many frameworks already exist that support developers in creating websites and -apps in various languages, eg. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) just to name a few. They usually follow the [MVC pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/mvc_pattern.htm). You can create a controller for every route and add a model as well as a view for this, all in separate folders. So far, nothing new, a well known and proven concept. However, several problems can arise regarding e.g. code quality, re-usability as well as best practices of SEO and much more. The architecture of these frameworks can lead developers to become inconsistent considering their code structure. Because the files are spread over the whole project, the reusability of code can easily suffer. In addition to that, the usage of templating systems like [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) can make the developer create invalid HTML code without recognizing it or create problems relating to for example page loading times [(which is a crucial factor)](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/), the [critical rendering path](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/critical-render-path.html) or avoiding ["extra whitespace between HTML tags to avoid browser rendering quirks under some circumstances"](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/spaceless.html). In the latter (a cite from the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/filters/spaceless.html) documentation), Twig has a property to prevent this, but you need to explicitly enable it and "*its performance is directly related to the text size you are working on*". Developing in these environments can run the risk of spreading those problems over your whole project, making it almost impossible to recover from without rewriting your code base.

So the idea was to create a framework that tries to minimize the impact of the stated problems without making compromises on the comfort of programming.

Therefore, lewp focuses on

- making it **easy** for the developer in **creating valid** HTML code,
- make the developer **instantly know where** the **files are stored**,
- ***true* modularity** and therefore **re-usability** of source code,
- **minimize** the [**cumulative layout shift**](https://web.dev/cls/) on loading
- applying **SEO** best practices already in development setup as much as possible,
- **minimization** **page loading times**, especially [FCP](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/) and [TTI](https://web.dev/interactive/),
- **flexibility** for the developer (you are able to add other dependencies to your modules without effort),
- **reducing** the **external dependencies** that are sent to the client and therefore
- **minimize** the **chaos in** your projects **source code**

lewp generates a highly optimized HTML web page and provides automatic handling of your CSS code (and your JavaScript soon) if you want to. Have a look at the examples folder for more information about how to use it.

‚ùó ***lewp is not a webserver.*** It is a framework that supports you in structuring your algorithms bringing them perfectly in line with your view, without letting your code get messy! It perfectly integrates with frameworks like [rocket](https://rocket.rs) or [actix-web](https://actix.rs).

## ü•Ö Project goals

1. ***Simplfying*** the creation of web pages ***without mixing programming languages*** or 
   putting logic into your HTML (like it is done in templates)

2. Creating ***modularized websites*** with ***truly isolated*** and ***reusable*** 
   components/modules, eg. automatically ***namespaced CSS*** and ***JavaScript*** (not
   implemented yet)

3. Providing a ***file hierarchy*** that is ***consistently throughout your project*** and can be ***shared*** between different projects

4. Getting the ***best of both*** worlds, ***server*** side and ***client side*** rendering

5. ***minimization*** of ***page loading*** times (especially FCP and TTI)

6. ***Removing*** initial setup ***HTML boilerplate*** code creation by the developer (the base
   skeleton with html, head and required meta, body tags are created by 
   lewp)

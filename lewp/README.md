Say goodbye to the web template hell. Generate your HTML5 website technically optimized and always valid. Without mixing languages.

*This is the adjusted Rust implementation of [the PHP version of lewp](https://gitlab.com/lewp/lewp).*

If you have questions, want to contribute or have any other type of request, your invited to create an issue.

## ‚ùìWhat is lewp?

Lewp is a collection of structs and traits that simplify modularized website creation and reusage of code without sacrificing the comfort of programming, speed and optimized serving of the resulting site.

## ü•Ö Project goals

1. ***Simplfying*** the creation of web pages ***without mixing programming languages*** or 
   putting logic into your HTML (like it is done in templates)

2. Creating ***modularized websites*** with ***truly isolated*** and ***reusable*** 
   components/modules, eg. automatically ***namespaced CSS*** and ***JavaScript***

3. Providing a ***storage with pre-defined folder hierarchy*** for easy resource management and possibility to ***share*** between different projects

4. Getting the ***best of both*** worlds, ***server*** side and ***client side*** rendering

5. ***Minimization*** of ***page loading*** times (for example FCP and TTI)

6. ***Removing*** any ***HTML boilerplate*** code. Lewp takes care of it

7. Applying **SEO** best practices already in development setup as much as possible

‚ùó ***lewp is not a webserver.*** It is a library that supports you in structuring your algorithms bringing them perfectly in line with your view, without letting your code get messy! It perfectly integrates with frameworks like [rocket](https://rocket.rs) or [actix-web](https://actix.rs).

## üì¶ Features


- [x] No more template hell in your code base
- [x] No more whitespace bugs in your website
- [x] Technically optimized, always valid, minified, HTML5 code
- [x] Component based development, truly isolated with minimum overhead
- [x] Storage definition with pre-defined paths for easy resource management
- [x] Uses [rust_embed](https://docs.rs/rust-embed/latest/rust_embed/index.html)
under the hood so all your assets are always available
- [x] Build the DOM completely in Rust

## üöå Planned feature list

- [ ] CSS can be split up into "render critical" (will be inlined on rendering)
and "non render critical" parts that will be inserted as `<link>`
- [ ] [html5-picture](https://github.com/emirror-de/html5-picture) support to be
able to scale the images to predefined sizes to optimize them for every breakpoint
you need
- [ ] JavaScript *per component* isolation
- [ ] Provide an API for localization (l10n)
